2020-10-15  Created initial project files
            * Created project process log
            * Created project folder on the repository

2020-10-16 Explored Data Sources
	    * Looked into registering for environmental data from ARGOS satellite
	    * (https://www.argos-system.org/)
	    * Found California Condor locational data over time
		- Potentially going to use this...exploring further
	    * Found shipping traffic data over time (want to visualize shipping traffic)
		- Each day is 200mb size is then 365*200mb which may be difficult 

2020-10-17 Aquired Data
	    * Got access to use ARGOS satellite data from NASA
	    * (https://www.argos-system.org/)
	    * Found various wildfire data sources covering CA and the greater US
	    * (https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/)

2020-10-24 Re-Explored Data Sources
	    * Stored wildfire regional data in geojson format
	    * Searched for more animal-related data

2020-10-28 Identified Data Sources
	    * Found Movebank.org, a datasource with a multitude of migration data
	    * (https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study204253)
		- Identified Swainson's Hawk dataset as dataset for my project
	    * Downloaded a few of the data sources and experimented with visualizing in Kepler-gl
		- Experimented with different available data formats to download from the source

2020-10-30 Experimented With Vizualizations
	    * Worked on visualizing Swainson's Hawk Data in kepler-gl
	    * (https://kepler.gl/)
	    * Did some background research on Swainson's Hawk	
		- Identified their unique migratory pattern and migratory trigger (wind direction)
		- identified need for new dataset to complement migratory data

2020-11-01 Explored Data Sources
	    * Searched for a wind-data source in u-v format
		- Need two seperate arrays to identify a u and v point for wind data
		- Plan on developing vectors for the wind data to see directional component

2020-11-03 Manipulated Wind Data
	    * Experimented with different wind data sets to see what dataset works best for my time-period
		- Identified data set from noaa.gov 
		- (https://psl.noaa.gov/about/)
	    * Utilized Panoply to visualize and construct wind vectors from the u v dataset

2020-11-06 Worked on Migratory Data
	    * Cleaned migratory data in .csv format
		- developed script to convert data from .csv format into .geojson format
		- developed script to create LineString shape object from unique birds in dataset

2020-11-07 Worked on Script
	    * Worked on geojson conversion script as well as fixing LineString object error

2020-11-08 Visualization
	    * Visualized and stored animation of wind vector data over time from Panoply
	    * Continued to search for wind-data to see if I could find a more granular dataset
		- could not find a more granular dataset satisfying my time window

2020-11-10 Re-Scoped Script
	    * When visualizing my migratory data, I realized the animation did not reflect what I had envisioned
		- re-scoped what the purpose of my script was
		- allow a user to see the path a bird flew over time, so the Linstring
		  builds cumulatively rather than being a single object

2020-11-11 Re-Wrote Script
	    * To reflect the above scope, I had to rewrite my script
		- modify the dataframe that outputs to be more encompassing of my original dataset

2020-11-13 Finalized Script
	    * Finalized script to wiht GeoJSON string generation and developed different versions of 
		Linestring visualizations

2020-11-14 Finalized Wind-Data Visualization
	    * Ran my final visualization of wind-vector data in Panoply 
	    * (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/)
		- exported animation for use on website

2020-11-15 Finalized Migration Data Visualization
	    * Rendered .csv and .geojson migration data in Kepler-gl 
	    * (https://kepler.gl/)
		- Tested different forms of visualization
			-- Decided not to animate Linestrings as more information is conveyed in static
			   visualization compared to animation
			-- Decided to animate the Lat,Long points for each bird to see movement

2020-11-18 Wrapped up Readme files
	    * Added links to files and cleaned up formatting

2020-11-19 Final Checks on Readme and project markdown files
